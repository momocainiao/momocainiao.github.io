**The 3-2-1 Framework for Learning**
To effectively master a new domain, adopt the "3-2-1 Framework." 

First, choose
#### **3 types of resources**: 
- select one authoritative book (a bestseller or highly rated work) for a comprehensive foundation, 
- one long-form channel (such as a podcast, blog, or YouTube channel) for in-depth understanding,
- one short-form source (like a social media account) for quick insights and inspiration. 

Next, commit to 
#### **2 forms of output**: 
- writing—through social media posts, journaling, or blogging
- speaking, which involves sharing your insights to improve your articulation and influence. 

Finally, dedicate 
#### **1 month to practice**. 
- Spend this time reading, digesting information, reflecting through your outputs, and building connections.At the end of the month, evaluate your progress to decide whether to dive deeper or pivot to a new direction.
