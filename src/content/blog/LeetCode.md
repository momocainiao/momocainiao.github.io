### Chapter 1: Greedy Algorithm

A Greedy Algorithm is a problem-solving strategy that makes the "best" or most optimal choice at each individual step, with the hope that these local choices will lead to a globally optimal solution.

### Chapter 2: Two Pointer Algorithm


The Two Pointers Algorithm is a technique where two indices (referred to as "pointers") are used to traverse a data structure—typically an array or a string—to solve a problem efficiently.

Instead of using a nested loop (which often results in O(n^2) time complexity), the two-pointer approach allows you to process the data in a single pass, usually achieving linear time complexity (O(n)).
