#### Sparse-View CT Reconstruction for Semiconductor and Human Imaging
**Summary**:
Computed Tomography (CT) is a critical imaging modality across both semiconductor inspection and medical diagnostics, enabling non-destructive visualization of internal structures. In medical settings, conventional CT requires many projection views, leading to high radiation doses, while in semiconductor inspection, acquiring dense projections increases acquisition time and throughput costs. A key challenge is therefore to **reconstruct high-quality CT images from sparse projection data**, reducing dose, time, and resource demands without sacrificing structural fidelity. This project aims to develop advanced sparse-view CT reconstruction algorithms that are broadly applicable to semiconductor devices and human anatomy. Traditional methods such as filtered back projection (FBP) fail under sparse sampling, introducing streaking artifacts and detail loss. To overcome these challenges, we will design **physics-guided deep learning frameworks** that integrate knowledge of CT forward models with the expressive power of neural networks. The approach will combine iterative optimization, learned priors, and data-consistency constraints, ensuring accurate recovery of fine microstructures in semiconductors and clinically relevant tissues in humans. The project will deliver novel methods with high-quality publications and presentations to advance both scientific knowledge and practical applications.
