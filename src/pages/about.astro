		Hi, I'm Yuxuan Yan (严俞煊).
	</p>

	<p>
		I completed my undergraduate studies in an engineering major and will begin my Master of 
		Science at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in 2026, specializing in Signal Processing 
		and Machine Learning. Currently, I am in the final year of my bachelor’s degree and spending 
		a semester at NTU as an exchange student.
	</p>

	<p>
		My academic and personal interests revolve around artificial intelligence, product design, film, 
		and reading. Over the years, I’ve grown fascinated by how intelligent systems work, how products 
		are shaped from ideas, and how good stories—whether in films or books—expand the way we understand 
		the world.
	</p>

	<p>
		This blog is where I record my learning journey and share the knowledge I accumulate along the way. 
		I enjoy breaking down complex concepts into clearer explanations, organizing scattered insights into 
		structured notes, and documenting the problems I encounter and the solutions I discover. Writing 
		helps me think more deeply, refine my understanding, and hopefully provide something useful to others
		 walking a similar path.
	</p>

	<p>
		Looking ahead, I hope to grow into a data scientist—someone who not only understands machine learning 
		models, but also knows how to apply them meaningfully to real-world problems.
	</p>

	<p>
		If any of the posts here inspire you or help you in your own learning, then this space has achieved 
		its purpose. Thank you for visiting.
